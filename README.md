A better version of this plugin has been found.

# IzaiahSun-Community.PowerToys.Run.Plugin.Everything

Module Only Copy of https://github.com/IzaiahSun/PowerToys

@IzaiahSun did all the work and I just extract this module for convenience.

Just put the folder under path-to-your-powertoys/modules/launcher/Plugins/

This is just the binary.(Maybe x64 only I guess?)

Source Code: https://github.com/IzaiahSun/PowerToys/tree/master/src/modules/launcher/Plugins/Community.PowerToys.Run.Plugin.Everything

I'll remove this Repo if there's any license problem.
